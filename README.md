I'm manually writing this entry on Notepad, saving it, and then I'll (try and) use git commands on a terminal to update it to GitHub. ("why?" - don't feel like explaining now)

Any formatting you see below here (until the end of this entry) was originally formatted by hand, for markdown (.md), using Notepad.  

Huh. cool.


"Today..."

* I'm thinking about self-hosting a private blog to use as a journal, with a cool project I found called Mataroa.
* Wondering about the middle-ground between striving for some degree of tech '_minimalism_' and the want of modern looking interfaces.
* 

Quote of the Day: "_\[Andy] Warhol said that in the future, everyone would have 15 mins. of fame. Well, *now* everyone will have their own creative world."

well here we go, gonna do the git stuff and take a screenshot as proof.

"Today I..."
* For the first time, manually downloaded an `.html` file, not by accident.
  * (was using it to save myself from having to Copy-Paste a bunch of text from a guide, across two devices/computers that don't communicate)
